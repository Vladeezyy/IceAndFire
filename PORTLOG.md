# Port log: Ice and Fire 2.1.13 (Forge 1.20.1) → NeoForge 1.21.1

Source: `AlexModGuy/Ice_and_Fire`, branch `1.20` (last commit 2025-09-05, "fix: #5543"), mod version 2.1.13,
LGPL-3.0. 707 Java files, ~92k lines. Dependency: Citadel (AlexModGuy) — NeoForge 1.21.1 build 2.7.1 exists on
Modrinth, so it stays an external dependency.

## Plan

1. Build skeleton (ModDevGradle, JDK 21, NeoForge 21.1, Citadel 2.7.1, JEI API).
2. Copy sources and resources from the original; keep packages and class names.
3. Resources: singular data folders, recipes/loot/advancements/tags format of 1.21, `forge:` → `c:`/`neoforge:`.
4. Java: registries (`DeferredRegister`/`DeferredHolder`), events, network (`SimpleChannel` → payloads),
   capabilities → data attachments, item NBT → data components, attributes/effects as holders, armor materials
   as registry entries, enchantments as data, worldgen/structures codecs, rendering API.
5. Fix the bugs below, then functional, stress and compatibility tests.
